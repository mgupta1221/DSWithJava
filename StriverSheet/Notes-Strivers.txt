 O(1) < O(logn) < O(n) < O(nlogn) holds true.

1. Use case for "Floyd Cycle detection algorithm (Slow-Fast pointer)" - Finding Duplicate element - Day 2
Cycle detection will only work when there are numbers from 1-N....For random nujmbers it will
not work becuase we are using indexes from 1-N

2. Use case for Merge Sort- (Questions with conditions like (i<j) and (num[i]> nums[j])
 i) Count inversions in an Array- Day 2
 ii) Reverse pairs - Day 3

3. 2 pointers technique is used in :
i)  3Sum (or, 4 numbers) with a target sum. - Day 4
ii) Trapping Rain water problem - Day 7

Note: 2 pointers appraoch always need Sorting

4.  Day 4 questions on array uses various important approaches like: 2 pointers, Sliding Window

5. For Linked list, try to use dummyNode logic, this handles many use cases:
dummyNode= new Node(-1);
dummyNode.next= head;

5. In DP, there are following two different ways to store the values so that these values can be reused: 
i)  Memoization (Top Down) 
ii) Tabulation (Bottom Up)

6. SubString in Java
startIndex: inclusive
endIndex: exclusive

String s="hello";    
System.out.println(s.substring(0,2)); //returns 'he'  as a substring  

String s="SachinTendulkar";    
 System.out.println("Original String: " + s);  
 System.out.println("Substring starting from index 6: " +s.substring(6));//Tendulkar    
 System.out.println("Substring starting from index 0 to 6: "+s.substring(0,6)); //Sachin
