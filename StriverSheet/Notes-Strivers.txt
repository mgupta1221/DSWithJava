 O(1) < O(logn) < O(n) < O(nlogn) holds true.

1. Use case for "Floyd Cycle detection algorithm (Slow-Fast pointer)" - Finding Duplicate element - Day 2

2. Use case for Merge Sort- (Questions with conditions like (i<j) and (num[i]> nums[j])
 i) Count inversions in an Array- Day 2
 ii) Reverse pairs - Day 3

3. 2 pointers technique is used in Finding 3 nums (or, 4 numbers) with a target sum. - Day 4
Note: 2 pointers appraoch always need Sorting

4.  Day 4 questions on array uses various important approaches like: 2 pointers, Sliding Window
