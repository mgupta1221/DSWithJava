Many quesitons of BST can be solved with InOrder traversal like:

Day 20
 1) Pre and Succ
 2) Validate BST
Day 21
 1) Floor and Ceil of Node
 2) Kth Smallest
 3) Kth Largest 


Key point is InOrder traversal of a "BST" gives the sorted node values

- Few Binary Tree problems are solved using Stack. E.g.
1) Flattening a tree to Linked list
2) Serializing a tree
3) BST iterator
4) Pair with given sum
