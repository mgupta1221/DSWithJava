Following 5 problems are part of the same family:
1) Coin Change permutation
2) Coin Change Combination
3) Target Sum Subset
4) 0-1 Kanpsack
5) Unbounded Knapsack

- Diff between logic of Coin Chnage permutation and Combination

Agar coin repeat karna hai to Coin kar loop andar chalao - Permutation 
Afgar Coin repeat NAHI karna hai to Coin ka loop bahar chalao - Combination

- In target Sum Subset, one number will only appear once.
E.g. - For 7 target sum and given coins are 2,3,5,6
so {2,2,3} CANNOT be the answer as 2 is being repeated
Only {2,5} will be the answer

- Key note - Agar duplicacy chahiye to 1D , else use 2D
