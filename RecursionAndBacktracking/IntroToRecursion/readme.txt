Intro to Recursion: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Q5ed7PWJ8I&t=1s

1. Notice the difference betwwen PrintDecreasing and than PrintIncreasing
//Note: Everything before recursive call will execute when you go up in the recursion
// Everything after recursive call will execute wapas aate hue...

While solving problem with recursion- we assume approach will work for n-1 and write the codes. Good Example
is in solution of Tower of Hanoi


2. // How to understand recursion, See image attached for quick reading of the same

 3. //See Tower of Hanoi- Real application of approach for recursion using tree

 4. In Recursion: Follow either of them:
 Call Smart, Base case normal  
 Call Stupid, Base case Smart  



 5. Recursion can be solved using :
a) Faith and Expectation approach (Check "GetStairPaths" in 'RecursionWithArrayList' section)
b) Level and Options approach (Check "PrintSubsequence" in 'RecursionOnWayUp' section)


Explanation Vidoes for L&O approach:
