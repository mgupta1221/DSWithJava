Intro to Recursion: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Q5ed7PWJ8I&t=1s

1. Notice the difference betwwen PrintDecreasing and than PrintIncreasing
//Note: Everything before recursive call will execute when you go up in the recursion
// Everything after recursive call will execute wapas aate hue...

While solving problem with recursion- we assume approach will work for n-1 and write the codes. Good Example
is in solution of Tower of Hanoi
