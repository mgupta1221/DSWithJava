Imp Questions:
//PrintSubSequence
//PrintPermutation
//PrintKPC
//PrintEncodings -> good Question




a)  When you have to return All values from a recursive function in a list - we use Faith and Expectation 
technique which is Bottom-to-Up recursion
Example for these are in 'RecursionWithArrayList' folder


b) When you have to print all values from a recursive function(without returning result) - we use Levels and Options tchnique
   Example for these are in 'RecursionOnWayUp' folder


For more details on "Faith and Expectation" and "Levels and Options" approach see readMe file of IntroToRecursion



4) Apart from above, Check PrintPermutation question:

Difference between  Subsequence and Permutaiton
say, String is "abc"

Subsequence : "", "a", "b", "c", "ab", "ac", "bc, "abc"     --- 2^3

Permutation : "abc", "acb","bac" , "bca", "cab", "cba"      --- 3!
