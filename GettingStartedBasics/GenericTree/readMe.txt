// Check tip in "RemoveLeafs" question in "GenericTreeBasics2.java"

// See trick diagram for FindElement (same logic applied in "Node To Root" path  )

// Trees are symetrical if they are mirror of each...So you have to understand how to check if
// trees are mirror of each other..(Basics3.java)

// Find Ceil and Kth Largest element solution follow same pattern

// MaxSumSubtree and Diamter questions are similar
